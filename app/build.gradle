// This section is vital to include dependencies that enhance the functionality of our automation tool.
// The right dependencies are necessary to address various challenges, including network operations and UI automation.

dependencies {
    implementation 'androidx.appcompat:appcompat:1.6.1' // This dependency solves compatibility issues across devices, ensuring a stable UI.

    implementation 'com.google.android.material:material:1.10.0' // Addresses the challenge of combining modern design components into our app.

    implementation 'androidx.constraintlayout:constraintlayout:2.1.4' // Overcomes layout design limitations, making it easier to create responsive UIs.

    implementation 'com.squareup.retrofit2:retrofit:2.9.0' // This library facilitates network operations, ensuring efficient API communication with social media platforms.

    implementation 'com.squareup.retrofit2:converter-gson:2.9.0' // Allows us to easily convert JSON responses into usable Java objects for better data management and automation of account processes.

    implementation 'androidx.lifecycle:lifecycle-livedata-ktx:2.5.1' // Supports reactive programming patterns, essential for real-time data updates in social media management.

    implementation 'androidx.lifecycle:lifecycle-viewmodel-ktx:2.5.1' // Aids in managing UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way, essential for our 24/7 automated operations.
